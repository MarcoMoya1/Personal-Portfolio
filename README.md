This will be an ongoing project I will be working on as I gain web develompment skills. So far this project was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
I plan to add the use of API's, React, Node and other languages in the near future. 
 
 This porfolio will have an About Me section, a section to display my work and a section of how to contact me.
 This portfolio is an on going project that will improve with time and newly developed skills.
